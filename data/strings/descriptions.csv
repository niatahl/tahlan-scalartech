#Ships,,,,,
tahlan_filament,SHIP,"Representing a wholly unique approach to carrier design, the Filament-class Bridgehead Battlecarrier was the first ship class to carry a Renham-Bergenson-Device. Capable of maintaining a stable wormhole connection with an STDF Blacksite equipped for fighter operations, it acts as the de-facto hangar facility of the ship. While the device is large in size, it ultimately occupies far less space than normal fighter bays would and the larger facility it is linked to facilitates superior fighter maintenance. The saved space has been used to equip the ship with heavy armaments and powerful shielding, making it capable of going toe-to-toe with battleships in direct combat.

At the time of its inception, the idea of using a ship-scale Renham-Bergenson-Device instead of hangars was regarded as the keystone for ScalarTech Solutions to break into the market for Domain military contracts. Complex as the design is, its advantages can't be denied. With extensive trials having proven the stability of the wormhole connection under combat conditions, the Filament was going to be the poster child for the ScalarTech MilTec Division, offering a combat carrier with fighting power close to a normal battleship without sacrificing fighter capacity. Sadly the ship design was still undergoing trials with a number of Domain Battlegroups at the time of the Collapse, making it now impossible to know whether the ship would've lived up to expectations.

With the massive military buildup of the STDF in the early years of the Collapse, the Filament proved itself as the backbone of their fleets with its flexible mission profile and top-of-the line specs. While the Gown-class Battlestars have become truly famed as the defenders of Spindle, it is in fact the ever-reliable Filaments and their task forces that will swiftly react to any threat and deal with it, a service that is well-recognized within the STDF with Filament captains shown the same respect as those who command the mighty Gowns.",,,
tahlan_strand,SHIP,"Developed from the Filament, the Strand-class carrier sacrifices the former's direct combat potential to become a dedicated carrier, having been trimmed down to the minimum essentials necessary to operate a Renham-Bergenson-Device. Smaller in scale and logistical profile, what remains is an exceedingly efficient carrier.

With the Filament's great success as the backbone of STDF fleets, it proved only logical to create a more specialized carrier based on the now proven Renham-Bergenson-Device. Initial trials of the Strand in c+23 were promising and by c+26 it had entered full production. Initial worries that the automated constructor ships building the necessary blacksites within the asteroid belt might not be able to keep up with the increased demand, turned out to be wrong and soon the STDF had majorly improved its ability to bring fighter support wherever needed.

Since its full introduction, the Strand has become a common sight in STDF fleets, with many smaller tast forces built around one of these vessels. They may lack the prestige of the Filament, but they are nonetheless powerful workhorses and excellent command ships with their sophisticated sensor suite.",,,
tahlan_brim,SHIP,"Introduced by ScalarTech as a modern alternative to the Hammerhead, the Brim is an offensively-oriented destroyer. Capable of employing its high speed and Cycle Accelerator system in powerful hit-and-run attacks, it can take on larger opponents effectively and run down retreating vessels.

The Brim was one of the first military hull designs proposed by the freshly formed MilTec branch of ScalarTech Solutions. A fairly straightforward design with its heavy assault focus, the ship took advantage of ScalarTech's state-of-the-art power capacitor technology to enable its massive bursts of firepower. Having gone into full production before the Collapse, it brought in plenty of orders from planetary governments and was on the way to becoming a staple in PDFs across the galactic region.

Post-collapse the ship continued its distinctive service in the STDF as one of the most numerously deployed vessels. Reliable and armed with a lot of bite, the Brim is an excellent stepping stone for the careers of young officers.",,,
tahlan_hem,SHIP,"A hyperaggressive attack frigate with a purely offensive weapon layout. Sacrificing any effective point-defense capability, it relies heavily on its efficient shields and the high mobility granted by its fast-cycling Chain Skimmer for survival.",,,
tahlan_verge,SHIP,"An aggressive cruiser designed on the idea of upscaling the Brim. Heavily armed and outfitted with a Cycle Accelerator system, the ship has devastating firepower.",,,
tahlan_gown,SHIP,"The largest vessel ever constructed in the ScalarTech shipyards and the crown jewel of the STDF, the Gown-class Battlestar incorporates all the best technologies available to ScalarTech Solutions at the time of its construction. Lightweight for a ship of its scale, it relies on heavy shielding for defense and is armed with a terrifying array of weapon mounts, making it a potent combatant in of itself. Supplementing these capabilities is the largest functional Renham-Bergenson-Device ever constructed, allowing the Gown to maintain passage for 5 fighter wings operating via an STDF Blacksite.

ScalarTech Solutions allegedly first drafted the plans for the Gown around c-15, intended as a prestige project and to establish the relatively young corporation as a top contender for Domain military contracts. While the events of the Collapse led to multiple delays in the construction, a number of Gown-class Battlestars still saw completion in the early years after the collapse, quickly pushed into service as flagships of the quickly expanding number of STDF fleets as part of ScalarTech's efforts to secure their position in the Spindle system.

Having stood as a bulwark against hostile incursions into the Spindle system, the Gowns have become a symbol of the STDF's guardianship. Most notably the SDS Shield of Providence has become a permanent fixture in the night sky of Charkha, permanently stationed in the planet's orbit in a solemn vigil. The sheer reverence for these massive vessels can not be understated and the loss of one would strike a great blow to the population of Spindle's worlds.",,,
tahlan_margin,SHIP,"In essence a downscaled version of the Brim, the Margin-class attack frigate is an agile gunship with deceptively high firepower. Easily the most common ship in the STDF fleet, it is reliable and effective in most frigate roles.

The Margin is one of the few designs developed specifically due to customer demand. With the Brim's great success in various PDFs, many requests for a smaller-scale variant were made to supplement small patrol forces. While the Margin never reached mass-production readiness before the Collapse, the STDF saw great potential in the frigate and began deploying them in large number once it entered full production.",,,
tahlan_frill,SHIP,"The Frill is a robust destroyer with good armament and even better shields. Designed to be sturdy and hold the line in battle, it is also capable of pressing an advantage.",,,
tahlan_skye,SHIP,"One of the newest ship designs in the ScalarTech Fleet Roster, the Skye is an agile attack cruiser. To give it an edge in combat, the ship was equipped with an enhanced power core. While only capable of operating at full capacity for short periods of time without causing damage to the power grid, the massive performance spikes allow the Skye to quickly turn the tide in combat.

Introduces well after the Collapse, it is believed the design of the Skye was at least partially influenced by technological exchange with other factions in the sector. The ship made an immediate impact upon its introduction to the STDF fleet, enabling more aggressive tactics and being crucial to success in a number of strikes against pirate bases in the vicinity of Spindle. Despite this, the Skye remains one of the rarer ships within the fleet due to its late introduction and expensive manufacture.",,,
tahlan_skye_hana,SHIP,"A variant design of the standard model Skye-class, this ship was the test platform for an improved version of the limit release system. More flexible than the standard system, this alternate version is quite effective, but was deemed an insufficient improvement to outweigh the vastly increased complexity of the system structure. This particular example of this short line of test hulls was also further upgraded with a pair of Spiral torpedo tubes, likely salvaged from a destroyed Skirt-class frigate.

Despite this, the Skye remains one of the rarer ships within the fleet due to its late introduction and expensive manufacture.",,,
tahlan_tress,SHIP,"The result of further attempts to downscale the Bridgehead carrier design is an effective light carrier. While the shortened Renham-Bergenson-Device is still fully functional, the half-ring configuration doesn't allow for the performance spikes a proper ring configuration is capable of. To compensate, the ship was instead fitted with a Magmine teleporter to soften up targets or distract point-defense.

Often referred to as the ""Sawn-off Strand"" and other such monikers, the Tress isn't looked too kindly upon by most and written off as a silly idea. Notorious for the relative instability of its RBD due to the reduced ring area and its weird appearance, the class's service record tells a much more impressive story, reporting excellent operational reliability.",,,
tahlan_curl,SHIP,"Given the aggressive nature of other ScalarTech-designed frigates, the Curl was introduced to shore up their defensive shortcomings. Equipped with superior shields and a pulse drive system to keep it at the frontline of combat, it can draw fire for its allies.

Curl captains are said to be a crazy lot, as one would expect of anyone in command of a ship that is designed to charge into battle with reckless abandon. For many it is the stepping stone towards command of a Frill-class destroyer, often regarded as the Curl's big sister.",,,
tahlan_vestige,SHIP,"What is now known as the Vestige was originally a competing design in the ship development project that ultimately resulted in the Verge-class. Heavier than its counterpart, this design incorporated a number of experimental technologies. Upsized heavy weapon capacitor banks give it the capability to operate all mounted weaponry at above spec performance levels, allowing it to mount fewer, more powerful weapons as a result. The standout feature of the design, however, is the performance limiter override system, commonly nicknamed ""Berserk Mode"", a predecessor to the Limit Release system that would later find use in the Skye-class cruisers. Lacking the refinements of the later version, the Berserk system pushes the ship's performance well past all safety limits, turning it into a nigh-unstoppable force of corruption, but the absence of the emergency shutdown systems found on the Skye results in catastrophic system overload upon system shutdown.

The vestige prototypes proved extremely effective, but the design was ultimately rejected due to excessive production requirements and concerns by top staff that the Berserk system could lead to unnecessary losses of ships and crews. The few built prototypes were mothballed and put in storage for years to come, but were reactivated on a few occasions when STDF tacticians had a need for the particular capabilities of the ship class, each time performing to expectations and repeatedly raising the question whether to put the design into action. In the end incorporation of some of the Vestige's design elements into the new Skye-class finally put these considerations to rest.",,,
tahlan_skirt,SHIP,"A high-performance attack frigate that relies on its high mobility for defense. Armed with a pair of low-yield Spiral torpedo tubes, it excels at flanking and striking vulnerable targets. While otherwise seemingly undergunned, it is outfitted with a unique dual capacitor bank system that allows it to fire equipped energy weapons at doubled rates.

The youngest design in ScalarTech's fleet catalogue, the Skirt was only introduced after the First AI War. The ship employs a number of technologies that were still regarded as experimental at the time but ship trials provided sufficient confident and allowed the ship to go into full, albeit limited, production. With its high specs but lack of dedicated defensive systems, only the best frigate commanders are put in command of one of these ships, keeping their numbers limited.",,,
tahlan_midi,SHIP,"The textbook definition of a weapon with engines, the Midi was designed and built around her powerful Overcharge Beam weapon. With only limited defensive capabilities, it excels in a fire support role, bringing to bear a stunning amount of firepower between its primary weapon and mine teleporter system.",,,
tahlan_camise,SHIP,"Fast, well-shielded and capable of defending itself, the Camise is a large military-grade freighter and ScalarTech Solution's in-house alternative to the commonly used Atlas. While the ship sacrifices logistical capacity in comparison, its toughness has proven invaluable in the post-Collapse environment, requiring only light escorts to withstand pirate attacks.

Once the backbone of ScalarTech's at the time primarily civilian fleet, the Camise helped build the corporation into the logistics powerhouse that allowed it to break into the military sector. The ship's original design was in fact much closer to the Atlas, using the same universal container modules and less heavily defended. The Collapse in particular sparked a number of upgrades to the design, including the larger and better armored container units it now carries and the heavy military-grade shield emitters.",,,
tahlan_culotte,SHIP,"A large tanker based on the Camise-class spaceframe, the Culotte shares the former's heavy military-grade shielding and excellent speed, resulting in a highly capable hull. ",,,

#Fighters,,,,,
tahlan_thread,SHIP,"The Thread-class swarmer is a small and agile figher armed with a single high-velocity diffuse pulse laser that can pose a notable threat to most other fighter craft. While unsuitable for engaging larger targets by itself, it can effectively screen for bombers and distract enemy point-defense systems.",,,
tahlan_fiber,SHIP,"Built for the sole purpose of bringing a maximum amount of devastation to hostile ships, the Fiber is a heavy bomber carrying a single Type-13 Magnetic Hyperpulse Mine, short ""Magmine"", with exceedingly high destructive potential. Featuring a large blast radius and dual timed proximity and impact fuses, this inertia-launched mine is capable of taking out most kinds of targets and crippling any which might survive an initial strike.",,,
tahlan_cord,SHIP,"Effectively a Lacette with a fighter chassis constructed around it, the Cord is an excellent generalist fighter with plenty of bite.",,,
tahlan_plaid,SHIP,A defensive drone designed to compensate for the Skirt's lack of point defense weaponry.,,,
,,,,,
#Weapons,,,,,
tahlan_ruffle,WEAPON,"Modern as it looks, the technical design of the Ruffle is actually quite antiquated, firing a bolt of heavily energized particles that are high in destructive power, but relatively ineffective against modern starship defenses. ScalarTech engineers have simply used modern high-end capacitor technology to amplify the weapon's raw output to a point it can deliver solid damage to these defenses and is utterly devastating to unprotected hull.

The Ruffle was a post-Collapse project prompted by the corporations initial lack of production chips for plasma cannons. Looking for a replacement option, STS engineers eventually decided to simply scale up the String-type particle pulse gun and use their state of the art capacitor tech to amp up the particle energy levels. The resulting design is rather crude, but shows that sometimes raw power can be enough to make something work.",,,
tahlan_lace,WEAPON,"In need of a high-output energy weapon, but discontent with the heavy flux profile of blaster-type weapons, ScalarTech instead opted for a design using alternating pulsers to achieve high output through rate of fire alone.",,,
tahlan_lacette,WEAPON,"The little sister of the Lace, the Lacette is a downscaled variant that achieves the same rates of fire as the larger model, but sacrifices individual shot performance.",,,
tahlan_string,WEAPON,A small diffuse particle pulse gun designed for point defense. Quite effective as long as the capacitors last.,,,
tahlan_tousle,WEAPON,"Adapting the design principle of the Sabot SRM to a gun platform, the Tousle fires a splitting warhead that can effectively suppress shields.",,,
tahlan_stitch,WEAPON,An array of supercharged ion beam emitters. Capable of dealing considerable damage in addition to the disabling effects of conventional ion weaponry.,,,
tahlan_ocbeam,WEAPON,"The massive weapon at the core of the Midi-class cruiser weaponizes the ship's flux for a highly destructive directed energy beam. While it requires a considerable amount of flux to have accumulated to be able to fire, it only generates little flux of itself and can easily deal crippling damage to a target.",,,

tahlan_cycleaccel,SHIP_SYSTEM,Briefly triples cycle rate of energy weapons and reduces flux generation accordingly. Does not affect beam dps.,Weapons,,
tahlan_secondwave,SHIP_SYSTEM,Deploys additional fighters that can fight for a short time before returning to the carrier. Can temporarily raise the number of deployed fighters above the maximum wing size. All fighters gain increased speed for a short while after system activation.,Fighters,,
tahlan_chainskimmer,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Teleports a very short distance. Less range than a phase skimmer, but can be chained in rapid succession.",Mobility,,
tahlan_supercruise,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Switches all systems to supercruise mode, diverting power to the drive systems. Accelerates forward, increasing top speed by 50 and improving maneuverability, but reduces weapon ranges by 1/3.",Mobility,,
tahlan_swarmerstrike,SHIP_SYSTEM,Teleports in two squadrons of swarmers near the target to distract both point defense and hostile fighters.,Fighters,,
tahlan_magminestrike,SHIP_SYSTEM,Teleports a cluster of 5 emp mines to the target location.,Fighters,,

#Campaign,,,,,
tahlan_planet_jacquard,CUSTOM,"Having caught the remains of a planetary collision many millenia ago, Jacquard has formed an unusual ring of what could best be described as floating continents at the upper edge of its atmosphere. Rich in ores, they now supply the industries of ScalarTech and even house numerous industrial centers on their surfaces themselves.",,,
tahlan_planet_charkha,CUSTOM,"The jewel of the Spindle system, Charkha was once an almost terran garden world. While still inhabitable, the planet has been forever scarred by the catastrophic effects of the failed gateway experiment, massive tracts of land rendered infertile and the atmosphere irradiated.",,,
tahlan_planet_mika,CUSTOM,"Home to only a minor number of defensive facilities, Charkha's moon is effectively uninhabited, though a popular lullaby has it that a colony of lunar cats live there, watching over the children of Charkha in the dark of the night.",,,
tahlan_planet_ardor,CUSTOM,"Once an independent mining colony, Ardor fell into lawlessness during the events following the Collapse. While the STDF would like to just eradicate the pirate presence, it has repeatedly been deemed not worth the effort as STDF patrols have proven more than capable of keeping raiders at bay.",,,
,,,,,
scalartech,FACTION,"Originally a smaller corporation that specialized in advanced transport and drive technologies, it was only a few years prior to the Collapse that ScalarTech Solutions branched out into the military sector. With a promising line of new military vessels in development and the first few models in production having found good success with some planetry defense forces in other sectors, prospects for the young corporation were good. Like for any other corporation in the sector, the Collapse changed this all too drastically.

Cut off from the rest of Domain space and anticipating the chaos that was likely to follow, the corporation ramped up production of its new line of warships and established the ScalarTech Defense Force while at the same time forming an agreement with the planetary government of Charkha to act as the Spindle system's defensive force. While ultimately no more than a larger system defense force, the STDF's military might proved more than sufficient to dissuade opportunistic raiders from attacks on the system and guaranteed a semblence of stability. As the years passed without any signs of the gates reactivating, ScalarTech was transformed into state corporation, taking over government functions within the Spindle system, the role of CEO now an elected position. Now known as the Spindle Protectorate it has largely shed its corporate origins over the following decades.

Adopting a position of neutrality after the arrival of the XIVth Battlegroup and the subsequent troubles while agreeing to at least superficially follow old Domain regulations, Spindle has managed to maintain generally positive relations with most powers in the sector, even if only because military action against the by now heavily fortified Spindle system wouldn't be worth the effort.",,,
