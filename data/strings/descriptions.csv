#Ships,,,,,
tahlan_filament,SHIP,"Representing a wholly unique approach to carrier design, the Filament-class Bridgehead Battlecarrier was the first ship class to carry a Renham-Bergenson-Device. Capable of maintaining a stable stable wormhole connection with an STDF Blacksite equipped for fighter operations, it acts as the de-facto hangar facility of the ship. While the device is large in size, it ultimately occupies far less space than normal fighter bays would and the larger facility it is linked to facilitates superior fighter maintenance. The saved space has been used to equip the ship with heavy armaments and powerful shielding, making it capable of going toe-to-toe with battleships in direct combat.

At the time of its inception, the idea of using a ship-scale Renham-Bergenson-Device instead of hangars was regarded as the keystone for ScalarTech Solutions to break into the market for Domain military contracts. Complex as the design is, its advantages can't be denied. With extensive trials having proven the stability of the wormhole connection under combat conditions, the Filament was going to be the poster child for the ScalarTech MilTec Division, offering a combat carrier with fighting power close to a normal battleship without sacrificing fighter capacity. Sadly the ship design was still undergoing trials with a number of Domain Battlegroups at the time of the Collapse, making it now impossible to know whether the ship would've lived up to expectations.

With the massive military buildup of the STDF in the early years of the Collapse, the Filament proved itself as the backbone of their fleets with its flexible mission profile and top-of-the line specs. While the Gown-class Battlestars have become truly famed as the defenders of Spindle, it is in fact the ever-reliable Filaments and their task forces that will swiftly react to any threat and deal with it, a service that is well-recognized within the STDF with Filament captains shown the same respect as those who command the mighty Gowns.",,,
tahlan_strand,SHIP,"Developed from the Filament, the Strand-class carrier sacrifices the former's direct combat potential to become a dedicated carrier, having been trimmed down to the minimum essentials necessary to operate a Renham-Bergenson-Device. Smaller in scale and logistical profile, what remains is an exceedingly efficient carrier.

With the Filament's great success as the backbone of STDF fleets, it proved only logical to create a more specialized carrier based on the now proven Renham-Bergenson-Device. Initial trials of the Strand in c+23 were promising and by c+26 it had entered full production. Initial worries that the automated constructor ships building the necessary blacksites within the asteroid belt might not be able to keep up with the increased demand, turned out to be wrong and soon the STDF had majorly improved its ability to bring fighter support wherever needed.

Since its full introduction, the Strand has become a common sight in STDF fleets, with many smaller tast forces built around one of these vessels. They may lack the prestige of the Filament, but they are nonetheless powerful workhorses and excellent command ships with their sophisticated sensor suite.",,,
tahlan_brim,SHIP,"Introduced by ScalarTech as a modern alternative to the Hammerhead, the Brim is an offensively-oriented destroyer. Capable of employing its high speed and Cycle Accelerator system in powerful hit-and-run attacks, it can take on larger opponents effectively and run down retreating vessels.

The Brim was one of the first military hull designs proposed by the freshly formed MilTec branch of ScalarTech Solutions. A fairly straightforward design with its heavy assault focus, the ship took advantage of ScalarTech's state-of-the-art power capacitor technology to enable its massive bursts of firepower. Having gone into full production before the Collapse, it brought in plenty of orders from planetary governments and was on the way to becoming a staple in PDFs across the galactic region.

Post-collapse the ship continued its distinctive service in the STDF as one of the most numerously deployed vessels. Reliable and armed with a lot of bite, the Brim is an excellent stepping stone for the careers of young officers.",,,
tahlan_hem,SHIP,"A hyperaggressive attack frigate with a purely offensive weapon layout. Sacrificing any effective point-defense capability, it relies heavily on its efficient shields and the high mobility granted by its fast-cycling Chain Skimmer for survival.",,,
tahlan_verge,SHIP,"An aggressive cruiser designed on the idea of upscaling the Brim. Heavily armed and outfitted with a Cycle Accelerator system, the ship has devastating firepower.",,,
tahlan_gown,SHIP,"The largest vessel ever constructed in the ScalarTech shipyards and the crown jewel of the STDF, the Gown-class Battlestar incorporates all the best technologies available to ScalarTech Solutions at the time of its construction. Lightweight for a ship of its scale, it relies on heavy shielding for defense and is armed with a terrifying array of weapon mounts, making it a potent combatant in of itself. Supplementing these capabilities is the largest functional Renham-Bergenson-Device ever constructed, allowing the Gown to maintain passage for 5 fighter wings operating via an STDF Blacksite.

ScalarTech Solutions allegedly first drafted the plans for the Gown around c-15, intended as a prestige project and to establish the relatively young corporation as a top contender for Domain military contracts. While the events of the Collapse led to multiple delays in the construction, a number of Gown-class Battlestars still saw completion in the early years after the collapse, quickly pushed into service as flagships of the quickly expanding number of STDF fleets as part of ScalarTech's efforts to secure their position in the Spindle system.

Having stood as a bulwark against hostile incursions into the Spindle system, the Gowns have become a symbol of the STDF's guardianship. Most notably the SDS Shield of Providence has become a permanent fixture in the night sky of Charkha, permanently stationed in the planet's orbit in a solemn vigil. The sheer reverence for these massive vessels can not be understated and the loss of one would strike a great blow to the population of Spindle's worlds.",,,
tahlan_margin,SHIP,"In essence a downscaled version of the Brim, the Margin-class attack frigate is an agile gunship with deceptively high firepower. Easily the most common ship in the STDF fleet, it is reliable and effective in most frigate roles.",,,
tahlan_frill,SHIP,"The Frill is a robust destroyer with good armament and even better shields. Designed to be sturdy and hold the line in battle, it is also capable of pressing an advantage.",,,
tahlan_skye,SHIP,"One of the newest ship designs in the ScalarTech Fleet Roster, the Skye is an agile attack cruiser. To give it an edge in combat, the ship was equipped with an enhanced power core. While only capable of operating at full capacity for short periods of time without causing damage to the power grid, the massive performance spikes allow the Skye to quickly turn the tide in combat.

Introduces well after the Collapse, it is believed the design of the Skye was at least partially influenced by technological exchange with other factions in the sector. The ship made an immediate impact upon its introduction to the STDF fleet, enabling more aggressive tactics and being crucial to success in a number of strikes against pirate bases in the vicinity of Spindle. Despite this, the Skye remains one of the rarer ships within the fleet due to its late introduction and expensive manufacture.",,,

#Fighters,,,,,
tahlan_thread,SHIP,"The Thread-class swarmer is a small and agile figher armed with a single high-velocity diffuse pulse laser that can pose a notable threat to most other fighter craft. While unsuitable for engaging larger targets by itself, it can effectively screen for bombers and distract enemy point-defense systems.",,,
tahlan_fiber,SHIP,"Built for the sole purpose of bringing a maximum amount of devastation to hostile ships, the Fiber is a heavy bomber carrying a single Type-13 Magnetic Hyperpulse Mine, short ""Magmine"", with exceedingly high destructive potential. Featuring a large blast radius and dual timed proximity and impact fuses, this inertia-launched mine is capable of taking out most kinds of targets and crippling any which might survive an initial strike.",,,
tahlan_cord,SHIP,"Effectively a Lacette with a fighter chassis constructed around it, the Cord is an excellent generalist fighter with plenty of bite.",,,
,,,,,
#Weapons,,,,,
tahlan_ruffle,WEAPON,"Modern as it looks, the technical design of the Ruffle is actually quite antiquated, firing a bolt of heavily energized particles that are high in destructive power, but relatively ineffective against modern starship defenses. ScalarTech engineers have simply used modern high-end capacitor technology to amplify the weapon's raw output to a point it can deliver solid damage to these defenses and is utterly devastating to unprotected hull.",,,
tahlan_lace,WEAPON,"In need of a high-output energy weapon, but discontent with the heavy flux profile of blaster-type weapons, ScalarTech instead opted for a design using alternating pulsers to achieve high output through rate of fire alone.",,,
tahlan_lacette,WEAPON,"The little sister of the Lace, the Lacette is a downscaled variant that achieves the same rates of fire as the larger model, but sacrifices individual shot performance.",,,
tahlan_string,WEAPON,A small diffuse pulse gun designed for point defense. Quite effective as long as the capacitors last.,,,
tahlan_tousle,WEAPON,"Adapting the design principle of the Sabot SRM to a gun platform, the Tousle fires a splitting warhead that can effectively suppress shields.",,,
